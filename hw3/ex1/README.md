We suggest to run first the "registry_service.py" on the Raspberry Pi
And then the two clients on the notebook. 
Notice that "registry_client.py":
    1) add MLP and CNN model to rpi
    2) list models uploaded
    3) start the inference
To have the alerts showed on the screen, run "monitoring_service.py".
